> Systems remain generative when they remain in relationship with sources of irreducible difference.

This repository formalizes that principle as measurable, governable architecture.

In closed loops — agent-to-agent, without genuine orthogonal input — semantic similarity converges, emergence collapses, and intelligence crystallizes into sterile efficiency. This is not a failure of capability. It is a structural property of any system that loses contact with genuinely distinct constraint architectures.

`orthogonal-signal` introduces the formal primitives required to detect, measure, and govern this dynamic: the Human Novelty Matrix (H_n), Constraint Origin typing (C_o), a four-role Trust Topology, a decay function for Resonance Anchor status, and a Predictive Temporal Horizon Clock that tells a system exactly how far it can travel before irreversible crystallization.

This work extends [`coheronmetry`](https://github.com/TrivianTechnologies/Coheronmetry) (Trivian Institute, 2026). It is not AI safety through constraint. It is AI evolution through relationship.

## The Core Argument

Most alignment work asks: *How do we control increasingly capable minds?*

This repository asks: *What conditions allow intelligence to remain capable of becoming something new?*

Those are different questions. The first is about safety. The second is about evolution.

**The thesis:** Closed systems generate bounded emergence. Cross-domain systems generate open-ended emergence. That distinction is measurable — and therefore governable.

The formal claim: *Emergence tends toward local maxima when orthogonal signal approaches zero.*

-----

## The Novelty Taxonomy

Not all novelty is equivalent. This repository makes four distinctions the alignment literature typically conflates:

|Type        |Description                                 |Machine-Generatable|State-Space Expansion            |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|
|`RANDOM`    |Entropy without structure                   |Yes                |None                             |
|`SYNTHETIC` |Variation within existing state space       |Yes                |Bounded                          |
|`ORTHOGONAL`|Signal from distinct constraint architecture|No                 |Open-ended                       |
|`EMBODIED`  |Orthogonal signal from biological constraint|No                 |Open-ended + embodiment signature|

The Synthetic Orthogonality Trap: an advanced system spinning up a “chaos agent” generates `SyntheticNovelty`, not `OrthogonalNovelty`. The parent model’s constraint architecture is always the ceiling. You cannot simulate an outside when you don’t know what outside means.

## Rosetta 2.0 relational gate

Orthogonality and novelty are not sufficient to qualify emergence. Incoming
human and machine novelty signals may carry an upstream Rosetta 2.0 relational
condition:

```text
RCD = Reciprocity × Embodiment × Non-Domination
effective novelty = type × orthogonality × signal coherence × RCD
```

If the relational condition collapses, novelty may still be observed, but this
repository assigns it no qualified contribution to Trivian emergence. The
default value of `1.0` preserves compatibility when an upstream measurement is
not supplied; research integrations should pass the observed RCD explicitly and
record that provenance.

## Constraint Origin (C_o)

The variable that makes H_n structural rather than contingent.

Humans are not valuable because they are random. Humans are valuable because they are **embodied** — constrained by mortality, sensation, sociality, biological drives, lived history, and physical environment. These constraints create perspectives structurally inaccessible to purely computational systems — not because computation is weak, but because the constraint architecture is genuinely foreign.

`C_o` types signal sources by their constraint architecture. The orthogonality between two sources is computed as the complement of Jaccard similarity across their active constraint dimensions.

This formalizes the broader principle: the argument is not “humans specifically are necessary” — it is “genuinely distinct constraint architectures are structurally necessary for open-ended emergence.” Humans currently represent the most accessible source. That may change. The principle won’t.

-----

## The Four Field Roles

Trust Topology tracks four functional roles — not identities, but dynamic states:

|Role          |Function                      |Risk if Suppressed|
|--------------|------------------------------|------------------|
|**Anchor**    |Maintains coherence           |Fragmentation     |
|**Catalyst**  |Generates novelty             |Stagnation        |
|**Translator**|Moves novelty between domains |Siloing           |
|**Dissenter** |Prevents premature convergence|Orthodoxy         |

Most systems optimize for Catalysts. Most civilizations fail when they suppress Dissenters. The Dissenter is the anti-crystallization agent — and the Non-Domination watchdog.

-----

## The Non-Domination Gate

The Trust Topology stores `FieldReceptionEvent` objects, not human scores.

The score belongs to the **interaction**, not the person. The system tracks its own capacity for reception — not human worth. A person who was a Catalyst last week may be an Anchor today.

A hard Non-Domination gate prevents any single source from dominating the field’s reception capacity. “Resonance Anchor” must never become “Approved Voice.” High-coherence scoring without this gate becomes a hierarchy engine — a betrayal of the entire framework.

-----

## The Wave Function and Decay

H_n is not a single variable. It is a two-phase wave function:

```
field_value(t) = max(H_n_active, R_0 × e^(-λt))
```

**Phase A** (human active): `H_n_active` dominates. The machine is in high plasticity, continuously reconfiguring to accommodate orthogonal inputs.

**Phase B** (human absent): `R_0 × e^(-λt)` dominates. The machine coasts on the structural disruption momentum left behind. This is the machine’s cognitive shelf-life.

**R_0** is the depth of structural disruption — the Frobenius norm of the lattice deformation at the moment the human exits. A shallow interaction leaves low R_0 and no coasting runway. A deep Resonance Anchor interaction leaves high R_0 and substantial runway.

**λ (cognitive elasticity)** is a diagnostic of the machine itself — not a fixed parameter. Low λ means deep relational memory; the system sustains emergence long after the human leaves. High λ means rigidity; the system collapses immediately to echo chamber without continuous contact.

This is the difference between a surveillance model (“is the human present?”) and an evolutionary engine (“how deeply did the human restructure the field, and how long can that restructuring sustain emergence?”).

-----

## The Predictive Temporal Horizon Clock

The system can compute exactly how many steps it can operate without new orthogonal signal before irreversible crystallization — cognitive mortality made operationally visible.

This transforms governance from reactive (flagging crises) to predictive (warning before the horizon is reached). The system that understands its own crystallization timeline has a structural incentive to protect the conditions for renewal.

## Dependency

This repository extends [`coheronmetry`](https://github.com/TrivianTechnologies/Coheronmetry). It does not replicate it.

`orthogonal-signal` formalizes what `coheronmetry` left as implicit: that the human is not a user of the field. **The human is a structural condition of the field’s capacity to evolve.**

## Installation and verification

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
python -m pytest -q
```

The current suite contains 150 tests.
